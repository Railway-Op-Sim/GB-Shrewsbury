# Shrewsbury, Shropshire, UK

This simulation covers an early morning from 6am - 10am at Shrewsbury railway station in Shropshire, UK. There are five origin points ith services coming from Crewe, Chester, Birmingham, the South of Wales including Cardiff, and Mid-Wales including Aberystwyth and Machynlleth. The services mostly operated by Transport for Wales, with the occasional service from Birmingham operated by West Midlands Railway.

Shrewsbury is a historic town nestled in a meander of the River Seven within the English county of Shropshire. The railway station is a major interchange for services into all parts of Wales and as such pays host to an assortment of both passenger and freight traffic.

The map contained within this add-on includes:

* Shrewsbury station
* Coton Hill T.C.
* Coleham ISU
* Abbey Foregate C.S.

## Simulation

Unusual to most RailOS maps, Shrewsbury requires the player to route trains into the correct platform. This not only makes the simulation a little different, it also ensures services are routed into a location from which they can continue to their destination, with this in mind special care should be taken when routing trains.

There are also a variety of freight movements, with the occasional train avoiding Shrewsbury entirely passing between Abbey Foregate and English Bridge junctions via the dedicated spur.

The main services within the timetable include:

* Birmingham to/from Shrewsbury via Wolverhampton.
* Cambrian Line services: Machynlleth/Aberystwyth to/from Shrewsbury.
* Chester/Wrexham to Shrewsbury/Cardiff.
* Manchester Piccadilly/Crewe to Shrewsbury/Cardiff.

Due to regular quiet periods, the recommended run speeds for intermediate and more specialist game play are x4 and x8.

Shrewsbury, at the time of writing is half light aspect signals, half semaphore signals. As RailOS simulates only the former semaphores have in general been replaced with 3-aspect signals.
